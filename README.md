<!-- --8<-- [start:contents] -->
`benchcab` is a testing framework that tests the CABLE land surface model across a range of model configurations and model versions. The tool:

- checks out the model versions specified by the user
- builds the required executables
- runs each model version across N standard science configurations
- performs bitwise comparison checks on model outputs across model versions

The user can then pipe the model outputs into a benchmark analysis via [modelevaluation.org][meorg] to assess model performance.

The full documentation is available at [benchcab.readthedocs.io][docs].
