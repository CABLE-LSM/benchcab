# CABLE benchmarking

Repository to benchmark a user branch (with personal changes) against the head of the trunk. The results should be attached with all new [tickets](https://trac.nci.org.au/trac/cable/report/1).

The code will: (i) check out; (ii) build; (iii) run both the head of the trunk and the user's personal branch across N standard science configurations.

NB. the code is flexible enough that "trunk" could be any branch, allowing the user to compare across personal branches.

## Multi-site comparison

Runs both cable executables (trunk and the user's branch) across a suite of FLUXNET sites, plots seasonal cycles and comparison benchmark statistics. Although these plots are generated locally, the results of each repository should be uploaded to
[Gab's benchmarking website](https://modelevaluation.org/) for further benchmarking and evaluation.

## Global comparison

Blah, blah
