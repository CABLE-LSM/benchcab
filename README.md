# CABLE benchmarking

Repository to benchmark CABLE. The benchmark will run the exact same configurations on two CABLE branches specified by the user, e.g. a user branch (with personal changes) against the head of the trunk. The results should be attached with all new [tickets](https://trac.nci.org.au/trac/cable/report/1).

The code will: (i) check out; (ii) build; and (iii) run branches across N standard science configurations. It is possible to produce some plots locally. But the outputs should be uploaded to [the modelevaluation website](https://modelevaluation.org/) for further benchmarking and evaluation.

For the moment, the benchmarking only works on NCI supercomputer.
