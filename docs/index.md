# About benchcab

`benchcab` is an evaluation tool for the land surface model CABLE. `benchcab` is designed to perform set standard simulations with two versions of CABLE. These simulations are then analysed together in modelevaluation.org to assess the scientific strengths and gaps in the two CABLE versions.

It is developed and maintained by the CABLE's user community and the ACCESS-NRI.
